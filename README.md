Overview
-------

This resposity aims at building car following dataset. We use a subset of NGSIM dataset, full dataset can be found [here](https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj).

#### Motivation:
Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program collected vehicle trajectory data on southbound US 101 and Lankershim Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA, eastbound I-80 in Emeryville, CA and Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. We want to find the trajectories of vehicles and fit the data to our car-following model. This resposity aims at find sequences of vehicles and corresponding trajectory information where the vehicles inside the sequences follow each other without lane changing or extra vehicles enter the sequences during a time interval.

Part1. Lane Change Analysis
